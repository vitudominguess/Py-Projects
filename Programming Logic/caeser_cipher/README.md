# Caeser Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher algorithm where each letter in the original text is shifted a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

## Getting Started
- Download the project files to your system.
- Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project files are located.
- Run the following command: ```python caeser_cipher.py```
- Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to provide the input message and the Shift key.
- The encrypted message will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt.

## Example
For validation purposes, the input message only accepts uppercase letters, digits, and spaces, which are included in the final message. Any invalid character or shift key will return to the input.
